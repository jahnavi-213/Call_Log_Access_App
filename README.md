# **CALL LOG ACCESS APP**

Developing a Call Log Access App using Flutter.
The main functionality of this app is to allow users to access and view their call logs. Retrieve and display the call history, including details such as the caller's name, phone number, call duration, and timestamp. Implement a user interface that enables easy navigation and interaction with the call log data.
